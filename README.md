# odin-landing-page-flex
17 august 2023:

On this exercise I found myself having way less trouble than I first expected. Most probably because I truely spent some time learning the theory. But maybe also because I've already seen some flexboxes before. 

BUT !! (there's always a But - hehe) 
But the truth is I still don't feel confident, and I'm hoping the course will make me come back to playing with this project. Because I know I could optimize this code a lot as well as enhance the look of the page.

Per example I coded this page with the screen split between my code editor on one side, and the preview of my page in real time on the other side. It was smooth and all, but I reaized after finishing and setting my webpage preview to full screen to "admire" my work, that it was still all over the place. Quite a shame. 

Now, the project page says not to worry about different sizing, as we will look at that later down the road. So I'll just trust The Odin Project's team on that one and come back to fix this later.
